# Task Management System

## Overview

The **Task Management System** is a simple module that helps manage tasks for students and teachers. It includes functionality for creating tasks, assigning tasks to users, notifying users about tasks, and handling categories for tasks.

## Features

- **Task creation**: Create tasks with details like category, type, title, description, and deadline.
- **User management**: Create users with different roles (student or teacher), assign tasks to them.
- **Notifications**: Notify users about new tasks, updates, and reminders.
- **Task categories**: Organize tasks into categories (e.g., English, Math, Science).
- **Task Updating**: Modify or update tasks and notify users about changes.
- **Task Deletion**: Remove tasks and notify users when tasks are deleted.
- **Status management**: Track the status of tasks (not started, in progress, completed).

### USP (Unique Selling Point)

**What does the module do?**

- Creates and manages tasks and users.
- Assigns tasks to specific users.
- Automatically sends reminders when a task has not been started or when a deadline is approaching.
- Provides an API to interact with the system for creating, updating, and deleting tasks.

**What does the module not do?**

- It does not manage large backend databases or complex storage solutions.
- It does not provide any frontend or user interface components.
- The focus is on business logic and easy API usage, not on visual components or user interfaces.

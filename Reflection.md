## Name Table

| Identifiers           | Type          | Rule/Title from Clean Code              | Analysis                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| --------------------- | ------------- | --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **TaskManager**       | Class Name    | _Classes and Objects Should Have Nouns_ | The name of the composing class "TaskManager" describes what it does. It handles tasks and manages them. The class name is simple and consists of nouns, following the rule.                                                                                |
| **createTask()**      | Method Name   | _Methods Should Have Verbs_             | The method uses the verb “create” to indicate its purpose, following the rule that method names should be action-oriented. The name clearly describes what the method does.                                                                                 |
| **assignedTasks**     | Variable Name | _Use Meaningful Names_                  | The variable is plural, indicating a list of assigned tasks. The name is meaningful and easy to understand, representing its content well. It follows the guideline of using meaningful names that reveal the intent behind the variable.                   |
| **notifyStudent()**   | Method Name   | _Methods Should Describe Behavior_      | The method name clearly describes its behavior—sending a notification to a student. It follows the rule that methods should describe their function accurately. It’s specific and immediately gives the reader an understanding of what the method will do. |
| **isValidPassword()** | Method Name   | _Boolean Methods Should Ask a Question_ | The prefix “is” suggests that the method returns a boolean value, aligning with the convention that boolean methods should start with “is”, “has”, or “can.” Just as the name implies, the method checks if a password is valid.                            |
| **hashedPassword()**  | Variable Name | _Avoid Mental Mapping_                  | The variable name is straightforward and self-explanatory. It clearly describes that the password is hashed, which aligns with the author's rule about letting variable names be understandable and in no need of being translated or further explained.    |

## Naming Reflections - Chapter 2 (Clean Code)

To ensure my code is understandable and to make it easier for others to follow, while also separating concerns, I have aimed to use names for both classes and methods that are pronounceable and informative, or “intention-revealing,” as the author suggests. I’ve also tried to keep the length of the names appropriate to the scope of the method. However, this has been challenging at times. For instance, the method checkDeadlineApproaching(),felt too long. But at the time, I couldn’t think of a shorter, equally descriptive name, so I chose to keep it. There are other examples of longer names in my code as well.

For class names, I followed the author’s rule of using only nouns or noun phrases, avoiding verbs. On the other hand, for method names, I’ve used verbs to clearly describe what each method does. One issue I encountered was dealing with types across different classes. In the Category class, I have types representing categories or subjects. Similarly, in the NotificationSystem, there are types related to notifications. The Task class also includes types related to tasks. When I began organizing and managing these methods in my TaskManager, I found it confusing to keep track of the various types. I eventually had to revisit and rename some types to avoid this confusion. A further complication is that ‘types’ are a fundamental concept in TypeScript, which added to the complexity when managing custom types in my classes.

In hindsight, I feel that ‘Category’ was not a good class name, as perhaps ‘Subject’ would have been better and more descriptive. ‘Category’ is too vague and could refer to categories of anything.

I chose to implement a switch in my notification system to handle the different types of messages. This was done to simplify its use in other classes and tests, and to align with the assignment’s requirements. The author states that switch statements should generally be avoided and tolerated if they only appear once, which is the case for my module.

## Method Reflections - Chapter 3 (Clean Code)

I have strived to keep functions short and focused on handling a single task. Personally, I feel that this can sometimes make the code seem a bit cluttered. Of course, it’s easier to understand a method when it’s simple and small, but when there are several lines with multiple functions one after the other, and sometimes functions that are similar to each other, it can become a bit confusing to keep track of everything. Therefore, I used a lot of comments during the development of the classes to keep track of where I was and what I needed to do next. These were later removed and/or replaced.

Most of my methods are small and are only doing one thing, but some methods I feel could probably be split into smaller functions, However, due to time constraints and, in some cases, a lack of creativity, I kept them as they were. See the table below. I counted the lines without adding the lines with comments.

### Method Table

| Method Name                                                             | Lines | Reflection and Rules                   | Analysis                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----- | -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **private getMessage(type: string)** (./TaskManager.ts)                 | 19    | _Do One Thing_                         | This method does one thing—retrieves a message depending on the notification type. It is focused and adheres to the principle of doing only one thing.                                                                                                                                       |
| **sendNotification(notificationDetails: {})** (./NotificationSystem.ts) | 50    | _Keep Methods Small_                   | At 50 lines, this method could probably be refactored to reduce its size by breaking it down into smaller helper methods, especially for validation.                                                                                                                                         |
| **createTask(task: Task)** (./TaskManager.ts)                           | 20    | _Use Meaningful Names_                 | The method name accurately reflects what it does—creating a task. However, at 20 lines, it’s almost too long. It could probably be broken down into smaller methods, but currently, it still adheres to the principle of doing one thing.                                                    |
| **toString()**(./Task.ts)                                               | 20    | _Do One Thing_ and _Descriptive Names_ | The method follows the principle about methods doing only one thing, and it has a descriptive name. It converts the task object into a readable string format.                                                                                                                               |
| **async createPassword(password: string)**                              | 18    | _Do One Thing_                         | The method also follows the principle of methods doing one thing. It also accurately describes its function. The method checks if the password is valid and hashes it. Although it performs two tasks, they are closely related and part of creating a password. The action is asynchronous. |
